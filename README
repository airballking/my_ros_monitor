# monitor node -Supervisor

experimenting and testing own written monitor which surveils robot drives:
- republishes rosout_agg (rosgraph/Log msgs) on diagnostic topic (as diagnostic/DiagnosticArray msg)
- has a buffer of 3-5 secs
- offers a service to change the perceived loggerlevel of specific nodes
- monitor node- Supervisor was written in python

## Getting Started

git pull from: https://github.com/tina-v/my_ros_monitor

### Prerequisites

mandatory: Diagnostic (http://wiki.ros.org/diagnostics)

optional: rqt_robot_monitor (http://wiki.ros.org/diagnostics/Tutorials/Using%20the%20Robot%20Monitor)

### Installing

pull git repository.

### tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

start supervisor node by launchfile, for example:
```
<node name="supervisor_node1" pkg="supervisor_node" type="supervisor.py" output="screen">
</node>

```
By starting the node it will start to generate msgs on the topics: '/diagnostics' and '/supervisorNodeName/diagnostics' when a msg is published in rosout.
While node is running call the service:" set_logger_level_of (nodename, new logger level) to change the logger level of nodename (where 
nodename is a rosnode name (Ex. as displayed in 'rosnode list') with type string and logger level is a diagnostic level (scale 0 - 3) of type byte).
