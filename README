# monitor node -Supervisor

experimenting and testing own written monitor which surveils robot drives:
- republishes rosout_agg (rosgraph/Log msgs) on diagnostic topic (as diagnostic/DiagnosticArray msg)
- has a buffer of 3-5 secs
- offers a service to change the perceived loggerlevel of specific nodes

## Getting Started

git pull from: https://github.com/tina-v/my_ros_monitor

### Prerequisites

mandatory: Diagnostic (http://wiki.ros.org/diagnostics)
optional: rqt_robot_monitor (http://wiki.ros.org/diagnostics/Tutorials/Using%20the%20Robot%20Monitor)


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

launch file - launch node
call service:" set_logger_level_of (noden name, new logger level)
nodename - string rosnode name (Ex. as displayed in 'rosnode list')
logger level - byte diagnostic levels scale (0,1,2,3)

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
